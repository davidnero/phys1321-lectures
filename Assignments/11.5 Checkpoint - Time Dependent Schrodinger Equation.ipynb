    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important partial differential equation, at least for physicists, is the Schr&ouml;dinger equation. In one dimension the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for a particle of mass $m$ with no potential energy reads\n",

    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let's put our particle in a box with impenetrable walls, so that we only have to solve the equation in a finite-sized space. The box forces the wavefunction $\\psi$ to be zero at the walls, which we'll put at $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing the second derivative in the Schr&ouml;dinger equation with a finite difference and applying the forward Euler method, we get the FTCS equation\n",

    "where $a$ is the spacing of the spatial grid points and $h$ is the size of the time-step. (Be careful not to confuse the time-step $h$ with Planck's constant $\\hbar$.) Performing a similar step in reverse, we get the\n",

It's safe to drop the constant, however, because the Schr&ouml;dinger equation is linear, so the constant cancels out on both sides of the equation and plays no part in the solution. If desired, it's easy to normalize the final result.)\n",

    "Write a program to perform the Crank-Nicolson method for this electron, calculating the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(t)$ of values of the wavefunction for each time step between $t=0$ and $t=0.1$. Use the initial wavefunction above and $N=1001$ spatial grid points, so that $a=L/1000$. Since everything scales with $L$, the easiest approach is to set $L=1$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- First, given the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(0)$ at $t=0$, you will have to multiply by the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ to get a vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{B}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$. Because of the tridiagonal form of $\\mathbf{B}$, this is fairly simple. The $i$th component of $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    " $$v_i = b_1\\psi_i + b_2(\\psi_{i+1}+\\psi_{i-1})\\,.$$\n",
    "\n",
    " You will also have to choose a value for the time-step $h$. A reasonable choice is $h=10^{-4}$ (giving us 1000 time steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, you will have to solve the linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\,\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{v}$ for $\\mathbf{x}$, which gives you the new value of $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$. You could do this using a standard linear equation solver like the function `solve` in `scipy.linalg`, but since the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is tridiagonal, a better approach would be to use `solve_banded`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third, once you have the code in place to perform a single step of the calculation, extend your program to perform repeated steps and hence solve for $\\psi$ at a sequence of times a separation $h$ apart. Note that the\n",
    "matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is independent of time, so it doesn't change from one step to another. You can set up the matrix just once and then keep on reusing it for every step.\n",
    "\n",
