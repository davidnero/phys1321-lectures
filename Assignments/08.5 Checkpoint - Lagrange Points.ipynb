    "The [Lagrange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point) are the five points located around a pair of celestial bodies where the net gravitational field is exactly zero as measured in a co-rotating reference frame (i.e. accounting for the non-inertial centrifugal force). Your task is to calculate the five Lagrange points for the Earth-Moon system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a reference frame that rotates about the earth-moon system's center of mass, the effective gravitational potential is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V=-\\frac{GM}{r_E} - \\frac{Gm}{r_m} - \\tfrac12 r^2 \\omega^2\\,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G=6.674\\times10^{-11}$ m$^3$kg$^{-1}$s$^{-2}$, $M=5.974\\times10^{24}$ kg is the mass of the earth, $m=7.348\\times10^{22}$ kg is the mass of the moon, and $\\omega=2.662\\times10^{-6}$ s$^{-1}$ is the orbital angular frequency of the moon about the earth-moon system's center of mass. Note that the third term above is the *centrifugal force* introduced by working in co-rotating coordinates. The three distances $r_E$, $r_m$, and $r$ are measured **from** the earth, moon, and center of mass, respectively. Similar to some other problems we've seen\n",

    "where $(x_E, y_E)$ and $(x_m, y_m)$ are the locations of the earth and moon. Note that the earth is NOT at (0,0)&mdash;the center of mass is! To calculate the location of the earth and moon, use the fact that the radius of the moon's orbit is $R=3.844\\times10^8$ m.\n",

    "    \n",
    "The five locations where $|\\vec{F}|=0$, are called the **Langrange Points**. In principle, an object placed there could remain stationary relative to the earth and moon. (In practice only $L_4$ and $L_5$ are stable once small perturbations are considered).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a plot with the center of mass at the origin, and with the earth and moon lying along the $x$-axis (shown as dots or circles&mdash;they don't need to be to scale). Draw a circle to show the moon's orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a contour plot of $V$ on top of the earth-moon system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > Hint: By default, most of the contours will end up tightly bunched near the earth and moon (where $V\\rightarrow-\\infty$). You can use the `levels` keyword argument to `contour` to control where the contours are drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Verify that your plot resembles the ones on Wikipedia. Adjust `levels` as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Lagrange points are located at five places where the magnitude of $F$ is zero. Calculate the **magnitude** of the gradient by hand and write a function for it.  Use this function and a routine from `scipy.optimize` to locate the five Lagrange points.\n",
